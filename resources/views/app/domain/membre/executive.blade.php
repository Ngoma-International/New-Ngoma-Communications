                                                All leaders face moments when the talents and capacities that made them successful in the past are no longer adequate. Taking on a new or more senior role, managing a new initiative and leading change in the organisation, all require growth in new directions. Often this calls for both new skills and new ways of thinking.

                                                Our coaching process is tailored to individual needs, challenges and objectives. At the start of each engagement, we get the lay of the land via 360Â° assessments.  We work together with the leader to set goals, identify measures of success and build a customised development plan for getting there. Our objective is to zero in on the issue that will generate the biggest win and rapidly dive into it.

                                                Through a one-on-one, confidential relationship with a supportive leadership expert, executives build awareness of their strengths and weaknesses and develop new strategies, outlooks and skills so they can tackle challenges that they have not faced before. Coaching provides a rare and valuable opportunity for leaders to gain fresh insights and experiment with new ways of thinking and acting that will take them to the next level of performance.
                                            </p>

                                                Every coaching engagement is uniquely designed for a leader and his or her unique context. The focus is always on achieving business results and addressing the most pressing needs.

                                                What are the real issues that your organisation is facing? We will work with you to clarify this and identify the leadership skills that will generate the biggest impact. The foundation of each of our Leadership Development programs is a clear articulation of the mindsets and behaviors that your organisation requires of its leaders and managers. From there, we design programs (or customise existing ones) to address the specific changes that your organisation wants to push forward.

For maximum impact, our Leadership Development programs typically include a combination of focused one-on-one coaching with group workshops that provide opportunities for people to work together to solve their immediate business problems using new leadership and management approaches.

                                                Organisations rely on three mechanisms to achieve growth: organic growth, alliances, and M&As.  We can help them identify the combination that is best suited to their unique circumstances and help in the execution while being ready to challenge the assumption that bigger necessarily means better.
                                            </p>

                                                Also, as markets, technologies, economic and socio-political environments change, organisations must transform as well.  We can help them in bringing about this transformation in order to adapt to changing business environments.
                                            </p>

                                                Our focus is to make the most use of the human capital and potential in cultural change and cultural differences by fostering unity of purpose and unity in diversity.  We believe that, when treated as an opportunity, culture can become a source of progress as it enables leaders and employees to grow by expanding their worldview and frame of thinking to address new challenges.

                                                Our approach revolves around people and focuses on their results, specifically Rapid Results projects. These are projects that achieve quick wins and accelerated cultural changes. For us, success is about creating positive, sustainable change in 3-4 months, not 3-4 years.  We do this by tailoring training, coaching and interventions to suit your organisational development objectives.

                                                We also provide coaching that enables and supports leaders in becoming effective individual coaches.  We intentionally transfer our expertsâ coaching skills to leaders within your organisation. We nurture the ability to talk to employees constructively about their performance, wellbeing and career motivations and aspirations, which, in turn, leads to better engagement and performance.
                                            </p>

                                                And, of course, once the leaders within your organisation have mastered these coaching and development skills, they can support other managers and leaders in coaching their teams.
